This plugin allows you to use your touch controllers to control the motorbike in RIDE 5 for the UEVR mod. It works simply by calculating the difference in height betweem the controllers, and inputs left if the right controller is higher, and right if the lef controller is higher. The triggers can be used to accelerate and brake.
To use, download the .dll from [here](https://github.com/r-hackett/RIDE5UEVRLeanPlugin-/releases/tag/v1.0), open UEVRInjector.exe, click the "Open Global Dir" button, and place the .dll in the RIDE 5 plugin directory. e.g. the location might look something like "AppData/Roaming/UnrealVRMod/ride5-Win64-Shipping/plugins".
