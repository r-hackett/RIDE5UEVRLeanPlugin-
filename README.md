This plugin allows you to use your motion controllers to control the motorbike in RIDE 5 for the UEVR mod.
To use, download the .dll from [here](https://github.com/r-hackett/RIDE5UEVRLeanPlugin-/releases/tag/v1.0), open UEVRInjector.exe, click the "Open Global Dir" button, and place the .dll in the RIDE 5 plugin directory. e.g. the location might look something like "AppData/Roaming/UnrealVRMod/ride5-Win64-Shipping/plugins".
