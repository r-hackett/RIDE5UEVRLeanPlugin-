This plugin allows you to use your touch controllers to control the motorbike in RIDE 5 for the UEVR mod. It works simply by calculating the difference in height betweem the controllers, and inputs left if the right controller is higher, and right if the lefy controller is higher. The triggers can be used to accelerate and brake.
